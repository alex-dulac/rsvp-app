# rsvp-app

This webpage contains a template for event details and a RSVP form.

Populate it with your own details in the `.env` file and use your own images, otherwise the idea is to be a simple plug-and-plug.

It uses a couple third party packages, including:
- Emailjs (https://www.emailjs.com/) to send off the RSVP message to a desired email address.
- A neat simple image gallery, react-image-gallery (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`
